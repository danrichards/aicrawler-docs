# AiCrawler

Leverage Ai design patterns using heuristics with the Symfony DOMCrawler.

## What is it?

The Symfony DOMCrawler does great job building special-purpose scrapers. AiCrawler provides the means to build intelligent all-purpose scrapers, or something specialized. The over-arching goal for this extension is to take a AI approach towards scoring nodes on the DOM, based on interesting characteristics that can be defined by a heuristic. 

Scoring nodes using heuristics allows us to use our creativity to do some of the following things: 

1. Learn / gather something special in a large arrangement of data.
2. Reduce dependency on the DOM for finding our scraper's payload.
